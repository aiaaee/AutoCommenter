It randomly generates users to simulate commenters and allows the addition of new comments through an API. The fetch method is utilized for handling API requests. The project is currently a work in progress, with more features under development.


In this project, we decided to store the data using Firebase's data storage feature and add random users as commenters on the website using the RandomUser API.

The fetch method was used to handle sending API requests for this functionality.

The project is still a work in progress, and I am currently working on other parts of it.
